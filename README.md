## Instructions

This template uses the snowpack build system (https://www.snowpack.dev/).

1. Ensure NodeJS is installed.  Go here to install: https://nodejs.org/en/ (recommended: the LTS version).
2. In a terminal, `npm install`.
3. In a terminal, `npm start`. This starts a local server that serves up the contents of the `public` folder, and the js
in the `src` folder.
4. Your web browser should automatically open, but if it doesn't, your terminal window should contain helpful information.
