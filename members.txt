Design:

Came up with the initial idea
Finished slides 10-21 in the presentation, which covered:
-ethical concerns of the data we analyzed
-the fundamental reasoning behind the visualization [stock sentiment can be intrinsically tied to public sentiment]
-a description and rationale for the tools needed, and
-related works on the subject [including papers covered from class], citations

Implementation:
I have never used any of the development tools or languages involved in this project [hadn't even heard of 90% of them before] so this was a learning experience for me.

I got the Twitter box data embedding to work, and gave suggestions on how things could be implemented. Most of my time was spent simply trying to understand the code and how the APIs fit into the model.



Claudia Salazar (netid: cas18):
- Apply and get the TwiterAPI key
- filter the key to get the data only of the user at study 
- With the set up of my teammate Kimi, send the data of elen musk to a localhost, which was going to be used as the data in the fron end 
- Worked with Kimi to write code for sorting and getting the top twitter of the day of the user at study.
